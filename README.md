#Pianobar front end written with Sinatra for the Raspberry Pi
----------------------------------
## todo:
 1. fix browser refresh, I have it refreshing every 10 secs which is annoying. I'm sure there is a way to refresh on songstart with an event-command
 2. add station buttons, or at least a next station button
 3. clean up sloppy code
 4. format with sass or jquery
 

## use
-----------------
 1. edit you pianobar config file to point to event.rb
 2. look through both .rb files to make sure your paths are right
 3.
